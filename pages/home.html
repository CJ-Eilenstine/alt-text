  <h2>Why is alt text important?</h2>
  <p>
    We get it: it can be tough to keep track of all the ins and outs of best
    practices in the digital sphere. However, there are multiple benefits to
    remembering alt text for your photos.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accessibility. Alt text enables your website to communicate to people with
    disabilities or limited vision by describing images. Ignoring alt text
    creates barriers for people who cannot see content on your site and who
    navigate the site using a screen reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    Search Engine Optimization. Search engines like Google scan websites for
    matching words. Describing an image with alt text helps search engines make
    sense of your images and allows your page to show up in relevant searches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Connection Issues. Whether a person has images turned off or they are
    experiencing connection issues, alt text will appear when an image fails to
    load.

  Example of good alt text for the above image: Chancellor Paydar and a student dance on a colorful dance floor at IUPUI Birthday Bash.

  <h2>How do you use alt text effectively?</h2>
  <p>
    Not all attempts to use alt text are effective. Remember these best
    practices for using alt text. Describe what is shown in the photo itself;
    avoid adding complementary information as a caption might. Enter alt text
    for every image, except decorative images that add nothing to the text. Keep
    it concise; use no more than 10-15 words. Include any words that appear in
    informative images.
  </p>
